Welcome to the repository for the Exploit Mitigations Project Group! This is
the repository we use to organize our work. Please refer to our [charter] as
well as our [github pages website][gh-pages] for more information on our goals
and current scope.

The Rust Exploit Mitigations Project Group investigates past, present, and
future exploit mitigations, including hardware -assisted or -provided exploit
mitigations, and how they apply to Rust and the Rust compiler.

This Project Group aims to maintain and improve the existing, implement, and
research new exploit mitigations for the Rust compiler, and allow the Rust
community to better understand those exploit mitigations and how they apply to
Rust and the Rust compiler.

We do not receive vulnerability reports. For reporting vulnerabilities, see the
[Security Policy][security-policy].
