# Exploit Mitigations Project Group Charter

The Rust Exploit Mitigations Project Group investigates past, present, and
future exploit mitigations, including hardware -assisted or -provided exploit
mitigations, and how they apply to Rust and the Rust compiler.

This Project Group aims to maintain and improve the existing, implement, and
research new exploit mitigations for the Rust compiler, and allow the Rust
community to better understand those exploit mitigations and how they apply to
Rust and the Rust compiler.

## Goals

In the short term, add support for [missing exploit mitigations][1], and
organize and stabilize support for [sanitizers][2] in the Rust compiler
(initially for tier 1 targets and best effort for other tiers). Long term,
maintain and improve the existing, implement, and research new exploit
mitigations for the Rust compiler.

## Constraints And Considerations

We do not provide security response for the Rust compiler. For this, see the
[Security Response Working Group][3].
